Due to Spotify's restrictive API, you need to jump through a lot of hoops to view your own details in this dashboard. The easiest way is to follow the instructions on the notebook locally or via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DoubleGremlin181/Spotify-Timeline/HEAD?labpath=Timeline%20Dashboard(Minimized).ipynb).
